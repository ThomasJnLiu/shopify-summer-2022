## Testing
Unit tests have been written for the liked images list component in ```\src\components\LikedImagesList\LikedImagesList.test.tsx``` 

This tests that the component renders liked images correctly, and a "no liked images" message when there are no liked images. You can run this test by running: 

```yarn test```

## Reflections
If I had more time, I'd like to write more tests, making sure all components are rendered correctly. I'd also write tests for the asynchronous functions, using mocks to ensure image data is rendered correctly when a response is received.

I'd also like to add animations to my app using Framer Motion, and create effects like images popping in when loaded, and the heart and share icon animating when clicked.
